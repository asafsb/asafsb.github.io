The reasons to extend on-prem networks are unique to each environment and can be a temporary state during migration or a long term strategy to ease scalability and bursting to the cloud.\nVMW on AWS provides two options for extending an on-prem network to the SDDC - HCX Network Extension (NE) and Layer 2 VPN. While both solutions provide the same functionality they are different in several aspects. I won’t go into a detailed comparison in this post, but most users, especially if they are not very familiar with networking, will find that HCX NE is easier to configure and scale. L2 VPN, on the other hand, will provide faster recoverability from an appliance failure, and depending on how many networks are extended, it may use less compute resources on-prem and in the SDDC.\nSince version 1.9 of VMW on AWS, the NSX-T 2.5 Autonomous Edge is used, which is simpler to configure and more performant than the previous L2 VPN client. In this post I will demonstrate how to configure the HA functionality for the autonomous edge.\nWhen configuring a highly avaialable autonomous edge two appliances are deployed. The first edge that is deployed is the Primary edge and the second one is the Secondary edge. The Primary/Secondary value is permanent and simply indicates which edge was deployed first. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t represent which edge is active and handling the L2 VPN. This is shown by Active/Standby high availability status in the summary dashboard.\nDeploying the Primary Autonomous Edge and Configuring L2 VPN My colleague, David Zhang, wrote a great post explaining all the necessary steps to deploy L2 VPN on VMW on AWS using the autonomous edge. I followed David\u0026rsquo;s guide to configure L2 VPN and used the following values to set up the primary autonomous edge:\n Management IP - 192.168.1.240 External Port  Port – 0,eth1,192.168.1.241,24 GW – 192.168.1.254   Internal - left blank HA  Port – 0,eth3,172.25.53.1,24 GW – 172.25.53.254 Do not fill any other values in the HA section    The L2 VPN tunnel and network extensions can be created before or after the secondary edge is deployed. There is no significance to the order in which these actions are performed.\nDeploying the Secondary Autonomous Edge Step 1 - Deploy the autonomous edge OVF. Make sure the exact same edge size (medium or large) and networks as the primary controller are selected.\nStep 2 - Under network properties, enter the hostname, default gateway, management IP and netmask. Make sure the same subnet as the management network of the primary edge is entered. I used 192.168.1.242:\nStep 3 - The external IP of the secondary edge can be blank. After powering on the appliance it will negotiate with the primary edge and the same external IP as the primary edge will be configured in a disconnected state. As with the primary edge the internal port should be blank:\nStep 4 - Configure the HA port\n Port – 0,eth3,172.25.53.2,24 This port should be in the same subnet as the HA port of the primary edge Default GW – 172.25.53.254 Check the Secondary API Node checkbox Primary node IP – 192.168.1.240 This is the management IP of the primary edge deployed previously Primary Node Credentials – If you changed the default username of the primay edge make sure you enter that username. Otherwise, it\u0026rsquo;s admin Primary node thumbprint – To get the API thumbprint login to the primary edge with the admin user and type the following command:\n get certificate api thumbprint  Step 5 - Make sure the edge VMs are running on different hosts and migrate one if necessary. If DRS is configured on the cluster create a rule to separate the edges.\nValidating The Secondary Edge Deployment A couple of minutes after the secondary edge powered on login to both appliances to validate the High Availability status. Under HA Peer Address, each edge should list the opposite edge’s management IP as a peer.\nNote – for some reason the management and peer addresses list a subnet mask of /19 on the web interface even though the correct mask of /24 is configured.\nThe primary edge should have a Primary API server role and an Active HA status. Once the L2 VPN is configured its status will be Up:\nThe secondary edge should have a Secondary API server role and Standby under HA status. Once the L2 VPN is configured its status will be Doen:\nIn the Port tab you can see that both edges have port named lrport_0 with the same IP and Port ID. The GUI doesn\u0026rsquo;t indicate what is the status of the port but this can be found using CLI. To do so login to both edges with the admin user and type the command get logical-router interfaces and find the port named lrport_0. You can also type get logical-router interface \u0026lt;port id\u0026gt;. The admin state of both ports should be up but the op_state of the standby edge should be down.\nCommand output of the Active edge: Command output of the Stnadby edge: Autonomous Edge HA Failover Test To test the autonomous edge failover, I initiated a continuous ping with timestamp to a VM connected to an extended L2 network in VMW on AWS. After about 30 seconds to verify there are no drops, I powered off the active edge. The connection did drop but as can be seen in the screenshot below the standby edge claimed the external IP and re-established the L2 VPN tunnel in 10 seconds:\nAfter powering on the powered-off edge the HA status between the edges was re-established. The secondary edge remains the active edge and the primary will become active again only in case of an additional failure.\nSecondary edge status:\nPrimary edge status:\n","date":1589512636,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589512636,"objectID":"f07bb58df61465edeb1781c145bb34d3","permalink":"https://softwaredefinedcoffee.com/post/2020-05-14-configuring-l2vpn-high-availability-in-vmw-on-aws/","publishdate":"2020-05-14T22:17:16-05:00","relpermalink":"/post/2020-05-14-configuring-l2vpn-high-availability-in-vmw-on-aws/","section":"post","summary":"When we assist customers in designing a new VMware Cloud on AWS SDDC the question of Layer 2 extension comes up frequently.

The Virtually Speaking Podcast did a great episode about it recently. Most of these resources discuss the changes both the employee and employer must make regarding communication, productivity, and culture change. If you are not accustomed to working remotely, then maintaining visual communication and avoiding distractions will take time to get used to and incorporate into your daily routine. While these skills are extremely important and can feel overwhelming when you are thrown into the situation on short notice, it is also essential to keep basic ergonomics in mind.\nIf you’re working from home temporarily, you’ll most likely be using your laptop, possibly while sitting on the sofa or bed. Using a laptop this way for an hour or two to answer some emails may be OK, but spending an entire workday like that can be an issue. I’m not an ergonomics expert, but I do know that the basics are keeping the monitor at eye level and the mouse and keyboard at a position that will allow your forearms to be as parallel to the floor as possible. The way laptops are designed forces you to bend your back and neck which, over time, will cause fatigue and discomfort.\nI’ve been working remotely for about five years, so I’ve had a lot of time to fine-tune my home office setup. Some of it was provided by my employer (external monitor, docking station) and some were purchased by me throughout the years (chair, desk, ergonomic keyboard and mouse). If your employer can provide you with some equipment or if you already have a home office setup - great. If you don’t, hopefully I can share some tips that will help you improve your temporary home office experience.\nEven though I’m working remotely, travel has always been a big part of my current and previous roles. Whether it was visiting a customer, attending a training, or meetings at the company HQ, I’d find myself working solely with a laptop for longer than I’d prefer. Starting with purchasing an external mouse, I eventually acquired enough items to travel with a complete mobile office. This setup is lightweight, doesn’t take up a lot of space, and doesn’t break the bank. If you travel for work, you’ll also be able to repurpose it for that in the future. Here’s my travel setup sitting on my dining room table (which to be completely honest, functions as my desk when we have too many guests staying over): 1. Coffee I mean, can you really work without it?!\n2. Laptop Stand This is a must for positioning your laptop’s monitor at eye level. An adjustable stand is preferable to ensure you can adjust it according to your work surface and your height. I have two laptop stands - a stationary one at my desk and one for travel.\nThe two stands in the photo are the Roost (on the left) and iLevel2 by RainDesign (on the right):\n Roost Laptop Stand - I love this stand. It started as a Kickstarter project and an updated version came out several years ago. That team did a great job on the product - it’s lightweight while still being very sturdy. It also has three height options. I’m 5’7” / 170 cm and I use the middle setting, so it is suitable for taller or shorter people as well. There are some cheaper imitations out there (Nextand is the most obvious one) which should also get the job done. Rain Design iLevel2 - I use this stand at my desk and it’s pretty nice. It’s obviously not as mobile, but it looks good and is cheaper than the Roost. My only complaint is that even at the maximum setting, the laptop doesn’t reach eye level. For me, this is not the end of the world since I use it to complement my external monitor. However, if it’s your main screen and you are my height or taller, I’d consider a different option.  And then there’s the third option, which I used at hotel rooms while traveling prior to purchasing the Roost stand - a stack of books/drawers/pillows. It’s not the most elegant or sophisticated, but it costs $0, you don’t have to wait for shipping, and finally - it’s your home office, so no co-worker can judge you on your low-tech frugal setup.\n3. External Mouse and Keyboard Using a laptop stand pretty much forces you to use an external mouse and keyboard, otherwise your forearms and wrists will end up at a really weird angle that will cause more harm than using the laptop on a desk. Of course, an ergonomic set is better, but most of us probably have a mouse and keyboard lying around somewhere. If not, a simple wired or even wireless mouse and keyboard combo can be purchased for $20 or less.\nThe mouse I use for travel is a very simple HP mouse that I bought eight years ago while living in France. I picked it up at a local tech store for about 5€. There’s nothing fancy about it other than the fact that it’s the perfect size to just stick in a bag and not take up a lot of space.\nThe keyboard I have is a Bluetooth keyboard by iClever. It is an ergonomic portable keyboard, which is a really hard thing to find. It can connect to up to three devices and works with Windows, Mac, iOS and Android. Plus, when folded it takes only a little more space than my iPhone X: 4. Headsets (Optional) These are not a must but will make your working from home experience a lot easier.\n Headset with noise cancelling microphone - Even though you’re at home, noise can still be an issue. My previous apartment was on a main street not far from a hospital. At least five times a day, police cars, ambulances and fire trucks would pass next to my building with sirens blazing. I got used to it very quickly, but it did tend to startle people on conference calls and make them think I was living in a war zone. After using the basic iPhone headset for several years, I purchased the Plantronics 5200 following a recommendation from one of my customers. It’s designed to be a travel headset, but I use it all the time as my main headset. It integrates with Zoom, Teams and Skype, plus the noise cancellation technology on the microphone is excellent. I have had calls while walking down a windy and busy Chicago street and those on the call had no problems hearing me. Noise cancelling headphones - As mentioned, the noise at home can be a real distraction, especially if you do not live alone. I use over-the-ear Bluetooth headphones that I picked up from Amazon for $40 two years ago. They don’t have active noise cancellation, but they tune out enough noise for me to focus and still hear if someone calls to me from the other room.  In conclusion, for very little effort and potentially little (to no) cost, you can greatly improve your working from home experience. If you have any ideas for ways to improve your temporary home/mobile office, would like to share your setup, or have any feedback, please comment or send me an email.\nDisclaimer: this post was not sponsored by any of the mentioned products.
